/**
 * Prime_Or_Not class provides a method to determine whether a given number
 * is prime or not.
 * *
 * Problem statement:
 * Given a positive integer n, the goal is to check if n is a prime number.
 * A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no
 * positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
 * *
 * Intuition:
 * The algorithm utilizes a combination of basic checks and a loop to efficiently
 * determine if a number is prime, reducing unnecessary computations.
 * *
 * Approach:
 * - First, check if n is less than or equal to 1; if so, return false.
 * - If n is 2 or 3, return true (both are prime).
 * - If n is even or divisible by 3, return false (they cannot be prime).
 * - For numbers greater than 3, check potential divisors from 5 to the
 * square root of n, skipping even numbers by incrementing by 6.
 * *
 * Topics / Data Structures used:
 * - Mathematical computations
 * - Looping
 * *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(âˆšn), as we only check divisors up to the square root of n.
 * *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(1), since the algorithm uses a constant amount of space.
