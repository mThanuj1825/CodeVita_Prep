/**
 * Problem: Merge overlapping sub-intervals.
 * *
 * Intuition:
 * You only need to compare the current interval with the last added interval and merge them if they overlap.
 * *
 * Approach:
 * 1. Iterate through the intervals, and for each interval, check if it overlaps with the last added interval.
 * 2. If they overlap, merge them by updating the end of the last added interval.
 * 3. If they donâ€™t overlap, add the new interval to the result list.
 * *
 * Time Complexity: O(n).
 * Space Complexity: O(k), where `k` denotes number of intervals.
