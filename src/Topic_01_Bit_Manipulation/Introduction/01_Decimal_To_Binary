Method 1:
dec(7) = bin(111)

    2 | 7 - 1
    -----
    2 | 3 - 1
    -----
      | 1

- Do factorization with '2'
- Write the corresponding remainders on the right side of the current number
- After the factorization, write all the remainders from bottom to top

Method 2:
dec(7) = bin(111)

- We can use the "16 8 4 2 1" rule
- Like, '7' can be represented as, 4 + 2 + 1
- Then 16 8 4 2 1
        0 0 1 1 1
- The required values can be represented by '1', and others can be represented by '0'
